Given the collaborative nature of the competition, standard *exam conditions* will not be maintained to allow for team communication. Instead, we ask contestants to comply with the following:

- Clearly write your team name at the top of every piece of paper you wish to be marked.
- No food is to be consumed in the hall.
- Non-programable calculators **are** permitted.
- Devices with internet connectivity must not be used throughout the duration of the competition.
- Invigilators can be asked for definitions of words within the questions.
- You must not exit the hall with intentions of returning unless accompanied by an invigilator.
    - You are welcome to leave the hall at any time to take a break; please just ask.
