## Leo Doherty

### Applying for: **President**

My name is Leo Doherty, and I am currently a third-year Mathematics with Russian Student. I am from Derry in Northern Ireland, and have keen interests in languages, history, cooking, and of course, maths (particularly applied maths). 

I would like to put myself forward for the role of President.

I would like to nominate myself as President firstly because I have been deeply involved with SUMS over the past year as secretary, attending, organising, and helping with the administration of many of our larger and smaller events. SUMS has been an integral part of my university life over the past year, and as I have gained experience with the admin side of the society, working together with our committee for larger projects such as pi ball, the Christmas dinner, the staff-student quiz, and more. Through this, I have gained valuable experience in the running of such a society, the system through which the society is run, and the general methods of the everyday running of SUMS. I would be honoured to take on the role of President, as I have seen the hard work of our current President Dan, and the smooth running of SUMS over the past year, where both academic and social events have catered to our entire membership, and am so passionate about this society, providing a space for friendly mathematical collaboration, a place to learn from our peers, and also a place where we make friends, have fun and be a supportive environment for all our members. I have many ideas for SUMS, as well as building on top of the fantastic work of Dan, to further our effort to provide a wide range of spaces for our members, where those who are a fan of academic maths, those who are just looking to make some friends and socialise, and all in between, have a place where they can do that.

## Ella Yates

### Applying for: **Vice President**

Hi, I'm Ella a 4th year integrated masters maths student. This past year as social rep I've been part of the organizing and running of many SUMS events and through that have gotten to meet so many great people and make some amazing friends. I want to be Vice President to keep cultivating this open community of people enthusiastic about mathematics and to give even more people the opportunity to get involved whether it be to socialise, to learn or to do fun maths.

## Ifan Howells-Baines

### Applying for: **Secretary, General Committee Member**

Hi, I'm Ifan (they/them)! I am a 4th year integrated masters mathematics student, and I'm running to take the role of Secretary/General Committee Member.
 
I have been very active on the SUMS committee over the last few months, navigating many different roles. I have been a part of projects such as Pi Ball, STEM Ball, ICMC, the UK Integration Bee, SUMO, the SUMS website, Rewiring sessions, the SUMS Study Group, SUMS merchandise, and SUMS advertisement. I am enthusiastic to continue to take initiative on anything that comes up, like I have already been doing as a General Committee Member. I have taken detailed notes on everything I have done with SUMS, which means I am a good choice for secretary and that I can take the events I helped organise and improve them in the future. I'm passionate about cultivating and maintaining an interest in mathematics by thinking of engaging events and organising them.

## Tom Cooley

### Applying for: **Treasurer**

I would like to run for treasurer because I'm organised and enjoyed my first years in SUMS. I've had experience working in a bank and can handle budgets very well.

## Carys Williams

### Applying for: **First Year Rep, General Committee Member**

I am a direct entry maths student who moved to St Andrews in September from a small town in South Wales. I didn’t know anybody here before I arrived – most of the amazing friends I have made have been through maths lectures or networking through SUMS. I would love to get more involved in the society, and becoming a part of committee would give me the opportunity to do that. I thrive by keeping myself busy, but I always put in the hard graft to make things happen. I’m always up for a challenge. I’m passionate about encouraging people to get involved and making everyone feel welcomed and included. My positive experiences this year will give me the platform to help everybody, especially freshers, integrate into the society.

## Deyao Chen

### Applying for: **Technical Officer**

I am Deyao and I was the technological officer this year. I would like to run for the technological officer again. 

This year, I have built and maintained the sums website, consolidated and integrated all the various links into one place, continued maintaining and updating the sumo website, and built and maintained various discord bots to manage the sums and sumo discord by allowing people to get roles. 

I hope that I was able to demonstrate my value to the society through my actions this year. I have also done various other coding projects such as writing problems and maintaining the platform for competitive programming and doing some research in machine learning. So hopefully I will be even more fit for the role if I am re-elected next year. 

If I am re-elected, I will continue to maintain and update the two websites, respond to various request for other tech products that sums needs such as ticketing and payment. I hope I have proven to be useful and will continue to bring value to the team. 

## Ioannis Dabos-Doukas

### Applying for: **General Committee Member**

I am running for General Committee member.
I think I would be good for the role as I have experience in the same position and was nudged by someone who felt I would be good at the role.

## Niharika Chavan

### Applying for: **General Committee Member**

My name is Niharika Chavan and I am a direct entry second year Maths student. 

I'd like to apply as a general committee member, if possible. 
As SUMS members we're all united with our love of Mathematics, and I'd love to spread that enthusiasm by helping out at events and engaging with others. 

I hope you will consider me for the role.
