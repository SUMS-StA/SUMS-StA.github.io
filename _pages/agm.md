# President

## Leo Doherty

My name is Leo Doherty, and I am currently a third-year Mathematics with Russian Student. I am from Derry in Northern Ireland, and have keen interests in languages, history, cooking, and of course, maths (particularly applied maths). 

I would like to put myself forward for the role of President.

I would like to nominate myself as President firstly because I have been deeply involved with SUMS over the past year as secretary, attending, organising, and helping with the administration of many of our larger and smaller events. SUMS has been an integral part of my university life over the past year, and as I have gained experience with the admin side of the society, working together with our committee for larger projects such as pi ball, the Christmas dinner, the staff-student quiz, and more. Through this, I have gained valuable experience in the running of such a society, the system through which the society is run, and the general methods of the everyday running of SUMS. I would be honoured to take on the role of President, as I have seen the hard work of our current President Dan, and the smooth running of SUMS over the past year, where both academic and social events have catered to our entire membership, and am so passionate about this society, providing a space for friendly mathematical collaboration, a place to learn from our peers, and also a place where we make friends, have fun and be a supportive environment for all our members. I have many ideas for SUMS, as well as building on top of the fantastic work of Dan, to further our effort to provide a wide range of spaces for our members, where those who are a fan of academic maths, those who are just looking to make some friends and socialise, and all in between, have a place where they can do that. 

# Treasurer

## Tom Cooley

I would like to run for treasurer because I'm organised and enjoyed my first years in SUMS. I've had experience working in a bank and can handle budgets very well.
