# Leo Doherty

## Applying for: **President**

My name is Leo Doherty, and I am currently a third-year Mathematics with Russian Student. I am from Derry in Northern Ireland, and have keen interests in languages, history, cooking, and of course, maths (particularly applied maths). 

I would like to put myself forward for the role of President.

I would like to nominate myself as President firstly because I have been deeply involved with SUMS over the past year as secretary, attending, organising, and helping with the administration of many of our larger and smaller events. SUMS has been an integral part of my university life over the past year, and as I have gained experience with the admin side of the society, working together with our committee for larger projects such as pi ball, the Christmas dinner, the staff-student quiz, and more. Through this, I have gained valuable experience in the running of such a society, the system through which the society is run, and the general methods of the everyday running of SUMS. I would be honoured to take on the role of President, as I have seen the hard work of our current President Dan, and the smooth running of SUMS over the past year, where both academic and social events have catered to our entire membership, and am so passionate about this society, providing a space for friendly mathematical collaboration, a place to learn from our peers, and also a place where we make friends, have fun and be a supportive environment for all our members. I have many ideas for SUMS, as well as building on top of the fantastic work of Dan, to further our effort to provide a wide range of spaces for our members, where those who are a fan of academic maths, those who are just looking to make some friends and socialise, and all in between, have a place where they can do that.

# Ifan Howells-Baines

## Applying for: **Secretary, General Committee Member**

Hi, I'm Ifan (they/them)! I am a 4th year integrated masters mathematics student, and I'm running to take the role of Secretary/General Committee Member.
 
I have been very active on the SUMS committee over the last few months, navigating many different roles. I have been a part of projects such as Pi Ball, STEM Ball, ICMC, the UK Integration Bee, SUMO, the SUMS website, Rewiring sessions, the SUMS Study Group, SUMS merchandise, and SUMS advertisement. I am enthusiastic to continue to take initiative on anything that comes up, like I have already been doing as a General Committee Member. I have taken detailed notes on everything I have done with SUMS, which means I am a good choice for secretary and that I can take the events I helped organise and improve them in the future. I'm passionate about cultivating and maintaining an interest in mathematics by thinking of engaging events and organising them.

# Tom Cooley

## Applying for: **Treasurer**

I would like to run for treasurer because I'm organised and enjoyed my first years in SUMS. I've had experience working in a bank and can handle budgets very well.
